Hello World, welcome to by website.

Hi,. <br/>
I am Kai, pursuing my PhD and at the Center for Cognitive Science in Darmstadt, Germany.
I strive to understand, and I strive to create.

<b>General</b> <br/>
In Darmstadt in the research group by [Prof. Loes van Dam](https://www.psychologie.tu-darmstadt.de/institut_psy/personen_psy/personen_psy_detail_71552.de.jsp) I am studying the mind to learn from the mind. I am building models based on human behaviour using optimal control (OC) and machine learning (ML) to explain and explore cognitive functions. This approach, lately labeled as <i>neuroconnectionsims</i> [Doering et al 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03718) differs from an engineering perspctive on ML in that its objective is not optimization of performance per se, but testing and developing theories about the workings of our mind and brain.\\
My goal is to use these methods to better understand how we humans perceive the world, make decisions, and act, and use that understanding to improve solutions to engineering problems.

<b>TAM</b> <br/>
At TU-Darmstadt I am part of the <i>[The Adaptive Mind](https://www.theadaptivemind.de/)</i> project, where we cooperate with the [Translational Neuroimaging (TNM) Lab](https://tnm-lab.com/) from the University Marburg. Our collaboration focusses on the perception causality, its implications for embodied concepts like a sense of agency (SoA), and its disturbances in psychoses such as schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). \\
In our approach we explore implicite measurements of an SoA and ways to model an SoA using methods from OC and ML. We want to find out if the paradigms and models we develop can be applied as early behavioural biomarkers for diagnosing SSD or testing hypotheses about the inner processes of the disorder.

Have a look at our [Sensorimotor Control and Learning research group](https://www.psychologie.tu-darmstadt.de/sensorimotor/home_sensorimotor/people_sensorimotor/people_details_75584.en.jsp)'s homepage, if you are interested!

<!-- Hi, I'm Kai.

I like learning and understanding how things work. Our world, our systems, our minds.
The more complicated the better!
I also like teaching what I understood, discovered and solved to others.
That's why I added some topics to this site,
hoping that they help you find a solution or even get one of those sweet Aha-moments.

So, let me show you a few of the things I am enthusiastic about. -->
