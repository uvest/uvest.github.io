Hello World, welcome to by website.

Hi, I am Kai. <br/>
PhD student and Research Assistant at the Center for Cognitive Science in Darmstadt, Germany.
I want to understand, because I'm a scientist, and I want to create, because I'm an engineer.

In Darmstadt in the research group by [Prof. Loes van Dam](https://www.psychologie.tu-darmstadt.de/institut_psy/personen_psy/personen_psy_detail_71552.de.jsp) I am studying the mind to learn from the mind. I am building models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to explain and explore cognitive functions and I ground these models in human data. This approach was lately labeled <i>neuroconnectionsims</i> [Doering et al 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03718). It differs from an engineering perspctive on ANNs in that its objective is not optimization of performance per se, but testing and developing theories about the workings of our mind and brain.\\
My goal is to use these methods to better understand how we humans perceive the world, make decisions, and act, and use that understanding to improve solutions to engineering problems.

At TU-Darmstadt I am part of the <i>[The Adaptive Mind](https://www.theadaptivemind.de/)</i> project, where we cooperate with the [Translational Neuroimaging (TNM) Lab](https://tnm-lab.com/) from the University Marburg. Our collaboration focusses on the perception causality, its implications for embodied concepts like a sense of agency (SoA), and its disturbances in psychoses such as schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). \\
In my approach to this topic I am exploring ways to model the perception of causality. The goal is to design a model using neural networks that matches data collected by the TNM Lab on a behavioural and neurophysiological level and which we can use to test theories on the development of psychoses such as SSD.

Have a look at our [Sensorimotor Control and Learning research group](https://www.psychologie.tu-darmstadt.de/sensorimotor/home_sensorimotor/people_sensorimotor/people_details_75584.en.jsp)'s homepage, if you are interested!

<!-- Hi, I'm Kai.

I like learning and understanding how things work. Our world, our systems, our minds.
The more complicated the better!
I also like teaching what I understood, discovered and solved to others.
That's why I added some topics to this site,
hoping that they help you find a solution or even get one of those sweet Aha-moments.

So, let me show you a few of the things I am enthusiastic about. -->
