# Choice history effects on causality perception in Schizophrenia

My friends and I have somewhat built up a tradition over the last years. Before christmas, we all dress up, have a *Gl√ºhwein* on the christmas market and then go the the casino. Some of us winning, most of us loosing, but all feeling fancy. \\
Anyway, what caught my eye was the betting behaviour at the Roulette tables. Many bet on either black or red (both having on average a 48.6 % chance). Sometimes, at a table the same colour is drawn again and again, all black for the last 10, 15, 20 draws. Such is chance. Funnily however, if such sequences occur, more and more people are drawn to the opposite color. They are clearly influenced by the past outcomes of the gamble although there is no information in it - unless some trick is at work. Such is human nature.

Now, in our project in the course of [TAM](https://www.theadaptivemind.de/) we did not go gambling. In fact, it has nothing to do with gambling, but with decision making or rather with the perception of causality. So, why telling you about my - seldomly successful - adventures at a casino?

For this project, I revisited an experiment conducted by [Benjamin](https://tnm-lab.com/people/prof-dr-benjamin-straube/) and colleagues from the [TNM-Lab](https://tnm-lab.com/) in Marburg. They showed their participants a launching event of a blue ball "colliding" with a red ball and asked them whether they perceived the event as *causal* (the blue ball did cause the red ball to move) or *non-causal*.

The following little movieclip, generated by my colleague [Yunyan Duan](https://www.psychologie.tu-darmstadt.de/perception/home_per/people_per/people_perception_detail_75264.en.jsp), gives you an impression of such a launching event:

The experiment was conducted on patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (SSD) and healthy control (HC) participants. It allows some insights into the differences in the usage of temporal and spatial offset when perceiving causality between SSDs and HCs. \\
We were now wondering, if there also were other factors that are used differently between SSDs and HCs. And there my casino story comes into play. I was thinking that there might be a bias given the recent history of observed events. Especially, we were curious about the effect of the last choice.

... to be continued.
