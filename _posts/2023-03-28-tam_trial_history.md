# Choice history effects on causality perception in Schizophrenia

In this project in the course of [TAM](https://www.theadaptivemind.de/) I revisited an experiment conducted by [Benjamin](https://tnm-lab.com/people/prof-dr-benjamin-straube/) and colleagues from hier [TNM-Lab](https://tnm-lab.com/) in Marburg. They showed their participants a launching event of a blue ball "colliding" with a red ball and asked them whether they perceived the event as *causal* (the blue ball did cause the red ball to move) or *non-causal*.

The following little movieclip, generated by my colleague [Yunyan Duan](https://www.psychologie.tu-darmstadt.de/perception/home_per/people_per/people_perception_detail_75264.en.jsp), gives you an impression of such a launching event:
