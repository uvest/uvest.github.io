<b>General</b> <br/>
I am happy to be part of the <i>Sensorimotor Control and Learning</i> research group headed by [Prof. Loes van Dam](https://www.psychologie.tu-darmstadt.de/institut_psy/personen_psy/personen_psy_detail_71552.de.jsp). We are building models based on human (motor) behaviour using optimal control (OC) and machine learning (ML) to explain and explore cognitive functions. This approach, lately labeled as <i>neuroconnectionsims</i> [Doering et al 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03718), differs from an engineering perspctive on ML in that its objective is not optimization of performance per se, but testing and developing theories about the workings of our mind and brain.\\
I want to use what we understand about how humans perceive the world, act and interact in it, to improve solutions to engineering problems.

<b>TAM</b> <br/>
At TU-Darmstadt I am part of the <i>[The Adaptive Mind](https://www.theadaptivemind.de/)</i> project, where we cooperate with the [Translational Neuroimaging (TNM) Lab](https://tnm-lab.com/) from the University Marburg. Our collaboration focusses on the perception causality, its implications for embodied concepts such as a sense of agency (SoA), and its disturbances in psychoses such as schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). \\
In our approach we explore implicit measurements of an SoA and ways to model an SoA using methods from OC and ML. We want to find out if the paradigms and models we develop can be applied as early behavioural biomarkers for diagnosing SSD or testing hypotheses about the inner processes of the disorder.
