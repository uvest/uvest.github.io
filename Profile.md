## Position

Research Assistant \\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the Sensorimotor Control and Learning Group by Prof. Loes van Dam, \\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Center for Cognitive Science, Department for Psychology, \\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical University Darmstadt, Germany

## Mission

I am studying the mind to learn from the mind. I am building models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to explain and explore cognitive functions and I ground these models in human data. This approach was lately labeled <i>neuroconnectionsims</i> [Doering et al 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03718). It differs from an engineering perspctive on ANNs in that its objective is not optimization of performance per se, but testing and developing theories about the workings of our mind and brain.\\
My goal is to use these methods to better understand how we humans perceive the world, make decisions, and act, and use that understanding to improve engineering solutions.

## Work

At TU-Darmstadt I am part of the <i>[The Adaptive Mind](https://www.theadaptivemind.de/)</i> project, where we cooperate with the [Translational Neuroimaging (TNM) Lab](https://tnm-lab.com/) from the University Marburg. Our collaboration focusses on the perception causality, its implications for embodied concepts like a sense of agency (SoA), and its disturbances in pschoses such as schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). \\
In my approach to this topic I am exploring ways to model the perception of causality based on data c and own experiments. The goal is to design a model using neural networks that matches data collected by the TNM Lab on a behavioural and neurophysiological level and which we can use to test theories on the development of psychoses such as SSD.
